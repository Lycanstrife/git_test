   Explain what git clone does, in your own words:

   Git Clone, clones a repository to a new directory.
   It also creates remote-tracking branches for each
   created branch in the cloned repository.

   It also creates and checks an initial branch that
   is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s current
   active branch.
