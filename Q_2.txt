   Explain what the “upstream” remote is usually used for, in your own words:

   The Upstream remote is used to ‘push’ changes made back to the online repository.
   This means that ‘generally speaking’, upstream is where you cloned from (the origin).
   
   It’s the destination for all your git push changes.
